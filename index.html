        <p class="chunk1" id="par1">Caught up in telling stories of other people, this <strong style="color:#c64345">little Red Riding Hood </strong> often forgets to tell her own. </p> 
        <p class="chunk1" id="par2">But as she advocates fervently, anything can be a good story if told the right way - so here's more about </p> 
        
        <p class="chunk1" id="par3"><strong>Koh Jie Min: The Storyteller. </strong></p>
​
<p class="chunk2" id="par4">As an eighteen-month old toddler, Jie Min was already talking. Anything around her was a story to tell. She was vibrant, lively and always the life of a party.</p>
​
<p class="chunk3"  id="par5">Today, as an eighteen-year-old, Jie Min is still talking. Only nowadays, as a year 2 Mass Communication student, her storytelling abilities have expanded across various media platforms. Her works include audio, writings and other environmental and humanitarian endeavours. As long as they help her tell her stories, any medium is a good medium.</p>
 <br/>
 
 <p class="chunk4" id="par6">Growing up, her dream was to become a superhero. Today, as a storyteller, the superpower she has chosen is to give back to the society by putting her skills to good use. As the textbook definition of an Aries, she is passionate, bold, proactive and will never hesitate to do her best. She is a fast and eager learner that lives by the motto: <em>'carpe diem'</em>.</p>
 <br/>

<p class="chunk5"  id="par7"> In her spare time, Jie Min enjoys playing (and winning at) Uno games with her three other siblings, exploring nature spots in Singapore and giving back to the world she grew up in.
